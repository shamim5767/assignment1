        <h1>My Current Target</h1>
        <p class="target-description">Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a powerful combination for anyone aspiring to build and design engaging websites. HTML provides the fundamental structure and content of a webpage, while CSS styles and arranges these elements to create visually appealing layouts. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionality, allowing for real-time user interactions and enhanced user experiences. Mastering these three technologies equips you with the essential skills needed to craft well-structured, stylish, and interactive web pages, laying a solid foundation for further exploration into web development and design.</p>

        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p class="target-description">HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create and design webpages. It structures content on the web by using a system of tags and attributes to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</p>

        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p class="target-description">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements on a webpage. While HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS handles the visual appearance, including aspects like colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.</p>

        <h1 class="target-description">Javascript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language that brings interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites. Unlike HTML and CSS, which focus on structure and style respectively, JavaScript enables developers to implement complex features such as form validation, animations, and real-time updates without reloading the page.</p>
